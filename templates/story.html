	This would be a player's "profile". The goal is to allow for role play. This section could be a mix of profile with an emblem, a place to see achievements of a player etc. But also a small blogging system where the player can post short notes to develop his story as an empire in the game. I know people will want to create the sideral empire of cats and explain how it works, so that's for them.

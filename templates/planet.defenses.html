<h1>Defenses</h1>

<p>
Here the player can produce and deploy planet defense infrastructures. The producing part seem concurrent to Factories so we need to reflect a bit more that. But basically here, he could upgrade or active some planet magnetic shield. Deploy and build defensive turrets, prevent spying with special satelites. Something like that.
